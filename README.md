# chess
This application will allow you to play chess using console commands!
The program uses console input for moves in the game. Handles errors taking into account the standard rules of the game of chess.

Examples of stroke input:
    e2-e4
    d7-d6
    b1-c3
In the lower case, the first cell (the figure that will make the move) and the second cell (where exactly the figure will make the move) are written.

In order to finish the game, you must enter the command "stop" (without quotes).
